# World-Building-Template
A world-building template for CherryTree note-taking software.

You can download the database zip file [here](https://github.com/mm47/World-Building-Template/releases/tag/zipfile). Some nodes have templates of their own (Character Sheet1 and CityName1), but the majority of the nodes are empty. Obviously, you can add and delete things to your liking.

## INSTALLATION

Unzip the "worldbuildingTemplate.zip" file. From a cherrytree instance, click on "Import" then "From CherryTree File". If your instance already has nodes, it will prompt "Who is the Parent?", select "The Tree Root", it will add down below all the other nodes.



## The node tree look like this:
